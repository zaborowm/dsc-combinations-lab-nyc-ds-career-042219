    "Now, let's dive into combinations. In the previous lab, you saw how the order was important when using permutations. Cracking a code is one example, but what if the order doesn't matter, for example, when an engaged couple wants to pick 3 wedding cakes from a list of 15? You'll need to use another technique here, and this is where combinations come in handy!\n",
